# RuleSelect

## Introduction

The `RuleSelect` component is used to implement addition and deletion based on multiple rules. In the work, it is necessary to add a condition, and at the same time, it can add and delete elements. Actually, it is troublesome to deal with it. Here, the basic ones are packaged for everyone. If you encounter similar scenarios, you can directly modify the source code.

## Code Demonstration

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Error } from 'dumiCompoent';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Error/>
  );
};
export default App;
```
