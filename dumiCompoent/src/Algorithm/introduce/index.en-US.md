# Introduction

## 1. What is algorithm?

Algorithm is a series of steps to solve specific problems. It is a thinking method and a specification to solve problems. In simple terms, the algorithm is the solution plan.

## 2. Why do we need to learn algorithms?

Many partners may say "we front-end programmers don't need to learn algorithms, it's useless". Actually, in development, algorithms are everywhere. For example, implementing a counter, implementing a compase function, implementing a generator... We will encounter many of them, but we are not very familiar with their collective name "algorithm".

## 3. Classification of algorithms

- Deterministic algorithm: Each step of the algorithm has a determined input and output.
- Non-deterministic algorithm: Each step of the algorithm may have different inputs and outputs.
- Input-output bounded algorithm: The input of the algorithm is finite, and the output is also finite.

## 4. The purpose of learning algorithms

- To improve our software writing and problem-solving abilities. This ability is needed in future work or project development. In other words, the purpose of learning algorithms is to cultivate a thinking framework that can really change the way we do things in the future, rather than just learning algorithms for the sake of algorithms, which will only close us up and ultimately lose our flexibility. By finding ways to think about the design and analysis process of algorithm implementation, rather than memorizing various algorithm implementation methods, we should learn the art of fishing instead of just learning how to fish.
- We can't memorize various algorithm implementation methods when learning algorithms, but cultivate our practical problem-solving abilities through the study of these algorithms. Especially the design and analysis process of algorithm implementation. The ability to solve practical problems is reflected in whether you can solve problems by yourself or whether you have to ask for help by posting on the internet. This ability is generally known as programming ability.
## 5. Summary of programming ability
The famous Swiss scientist Niklaus Wirth教授 once proposed: **Data structure + Algorithm = Program**.
Data structure is the skeleton of the program, and the algorithm is the soul of the program.
In life, algorithms are everywhere. Every morning, brushing your teeth, washing your face, eating breakfast, you are calculating time to avoid being late for work or class; when you go shopping at the supermarket, under the condition of limited funds, you need to consider what to buy first and what to buy later, whether it will exceed the budget; when cooking at home, what ingredients and seasonings to use, what specific cooking methods and steps to take, and then taste whether it's salty or not, see if it's cooked or not. So, don't say you don't understand algorithms, in fact, you use them every day!
However, for computer professional algorithms, many people are confused: I can understand it, but I can't use it! Just like visiting the murals in Mogao Cave, seeing it, feeling it, but not being able to get into it. Every beginner needs a key to open the door of algorithm, just as what Tao Yuanming said in "Peach Blossom Spring": "At first it was very narrow, only wide enough for people to pass through. After walking for tens of steps, suddenly it opened up."
