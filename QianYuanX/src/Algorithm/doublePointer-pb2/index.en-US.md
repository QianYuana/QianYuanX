# Linked List Cycle II

## Problem Description
Given a `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

If a linked list has a cycle, you can find the cycle's start. There are several ways to define the start of the cycle. In this problem, we use `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**You should not modify the linked list.**

**Example 1:**  

![image](https://assets.leetcode-cn.com/aliyun-lc-upload/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
```ts
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: Return the node where the cycle begins
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the second node.
```  

**Example 2:**  

![image](https://assets.leetcode-cn.com/aliyun-lc-upload/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```ts
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: Return the node where the cycle begins
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the first node.
```
**Example 3:**   

![image](https://assets.leetcode-cn.com/aliyun-lc-upload/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```ts
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: Return null
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Solution**
```ts
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function detectCycle(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    // Check if head is null or head.next is null
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return null
    }
    // Initialize slow and fast pointers
    let slow = head
    let fast = head
    // When fast pointer exists
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        // Slow pointer moves one step, fast pointer moves two steps
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        // When they meet
        if (slow === fast){
            // Reinitialize slow pointer
            slow = head
            // Loop until slow pointer is not equal to current fast pointer
            while (slow !== fast) {
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next
            }
            // When slow pointer meets fast pointer, it's the starting point of the cycle
            return slow
        }
    }
    // If fast pointer doesn't exist or its next doesn't exist, there is no cycle
    return null
};
```
