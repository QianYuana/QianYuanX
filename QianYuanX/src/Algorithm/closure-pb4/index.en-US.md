# Allow Only One Function Call

Today we approach a closure problem: **Allow Only One Function Call**.

## Problem Description

Given a function `fn`, it returns a new function. The returned function is identical to the original function `fn`, except that it ensures `fn` is called at most once.

- The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as `fn`.
- For each subsequent call after the first one, it should return `undefined`.

**Example 1:**
```ts
Input: fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c), calls = [[1,2,3],[2,3,6]]
Output: [{"calls":1,"value":6}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(1, 2, 3); // 6
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn is not called again
```

**Example 2:**
```ts
Input: fn = (a,b,c) => (a * b * c), calls = [[5,7,4],[2,3,6],[4,6,8]]
Output: [{"calls":1,"value":140}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(5, 7, 4); // 140
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn is not called again
onceFn(4, 6, 8); // undefined, fn is not called again
```

**Constraints:**
```ts
- calls is a valid JSON array
- 1 <= calls.length <= 10
- 1 <= calls[i].length <= 100
- 2 <= JSON.stringify(calls).length <= 1000
```

## Approach
**Using Rest Syntax:** We can declare a boolean value to track whether the function has been called. Then, if the function hasn't been called yet, we can use rest and spread syntax to pass the arguments.

```ts
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @return {Function}
 */
var once = function (fn) {
    let status = false
    return function (...args) {
        if (status) {
            return undefined
        } else {
            status = true
            return fn(...args)
        }
    }
};

/**
 * let fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c)
 * let onceFn = once(fn)
 *
 * onceFn(1,2,3); // 6
 * onceFn(2,3,6); // returns undefined without calling fn
 */
```
